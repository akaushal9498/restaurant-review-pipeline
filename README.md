# Swiggy & Amazon Reviews Data Pipeline

This project demonstrates a full data pipeline that ingests, transforms, and loads data from two sources:
- **Swiggy restaurants data** (static JSON, updated weekly)
- **Amazon fine food reviews** (simulated streaming from SQLite)

The processed data is loaded into a data warehouse (e.g., Amazon Redshift), with support for monitoring, logging, and scheduling using Apache Airflow.
